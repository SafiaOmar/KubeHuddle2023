You are likely not using Argo CD, Flux, Rancher Fleet, or similar tools to manage the state of your infrastructure and services. Why is that? If GitOps is a great solution for apps, isn't it safe to assume that it would be equally beneficial for anything else? What is missing?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that most of the commonly used GitOps tools are managing Kubernetes resources which, traditionally, do not deal with infrastructure and Cloud services. That's what we need to change. We need to expand Kubernetes with custom resources that can manage anything, no matter whether that's AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, GitHub, Elastic, DataDog, or any other Cloud service. If we do that, we might convert Kubernetes API into a universal API. We might convert the Kubernetes control plane into a universal control plane. If we do that, we will get end-to-end GitOps through which everything is always in sync and where all we have to do is push changes to Git repositories.\r\n\r\nAll we need to make that happen is Crossplane (an open-source project donated to CNCF), combined with Argo CD, Flux, or Rancher Fleet. Let's see it in action.","startsAt":"2022-10-03T09:45:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T10:25:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"97fd9697-d280-4391-8e99-0e4698bc76db","name":"Viktor Farcic"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120909,"name":"Introductory and overview"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25859,"room":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null},{"id":"359754","title":"Clear Your Own Path to Open Source Maintainer","description":"How many times have you heard the phrase \"chop wood and carry water\"? What about \"look at the good first issues\" or \"triage the issues queue\"?  Or even \"go out there and make yourself known to the community\"? Open Source project members throw around these phrases as if they are the panacea to becoming a contributor, then a committer, and finally a maintainer. However, it is not that easy. \r\nThese phrases can only help if you know what they mean! Demystifying this path to leadership in Open Source is imperative to the industry because we can’t grow on a path to continuous learning if we aren’t welcoming the next generation of contributors to our projects with clear and inclusive language.  \r\n \r\nSo here are some better questions to ask yourself when approaching a new Open Source project:  \r\nWhat can I do if the first issues queue doesn’t contain any issues to work on?  \r\nHow do I introduce myself to the community?  \r\nWhat if I can't find anything on the issue queue that makes sense? \r\nWhat contributions are needed most by this community?  \r\nHow do I climb the community role ladder toward leadership?  \r\n \r\nPeople need guidance and support when climbing the mountain from the valley of becoming a new contributor to the zenith of maintainership. It is not always just as simple as following the community contributor guidelines. In this presentation I cover tips and trick on how to conquer that journey. Through practical examples of how I became a Helm maintainer, I hope that more people will realize it is within their grasp to become maintainers in Open Source projects. And the reality is that these projects NEED you too.","startsAt":"2022-10-03T10:30:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T11:15:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"2b2add40-e4d0-4686-b135-a90532540cb7","name":"Martin Hickey"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120909,"name":"Introductory and overview"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25859,"room":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null},{"id":"5282b2c9-e2d9-495b-b52f-7cd20887380a","title":"Break","description":null,"startsAt":"2022-10-03T11:15:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T11:30:00","isServiceSession":true,"isPlenumSession":true,"speakers":[],"categories":[],"roomId":25859,"room":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null},{"id":"343039","title":"Integrating Backup Into Your GitOps CI/CD Pipeline","description":"The ability to deploy code and version code has been a de facto requirement and a reason we have CI/CD pipelines for our application development, but with Kubernetes in particular we are seeing a closer tie between code and data.

However, it does not provide any capabilities for having more granular control on what resources can be created and what properties they might have. Validation webhooks fix that problem. They allow the user to define custom logic that looks at the resource being created/edited and, based on their properties, to allow or deny the operation.\r\n\r\nGatekeeper is an implementation of a validation webhook that uses Open Policy Agent and allows you to define policies via the Rego language. These policies are applied to the Kube API server and live in Kubernetes as first-class citizens.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will describe what validating webhooks are, how they work and how OPA and Gatekeeper leverage this functionality to protect your Kubernetes cluster.

The pattern has seen increased usage and adoption in production environments and serves a variety of platform-agnostic use cases such as collecting metrics and proxying traffic. Sidecar containers work well with most Kubernetes primitives, such as deployments, but they fall short when used in job objects. For service meshes or metric collectors, sidecars need to run continuously, blocking jobs from completing even after the main container has finished its work. \r\n","startsAt":"2022-10-03T14:20:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T14:40:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"90531675-78bd-4c6d-af22-8c2bb0f4bb09","name":"Matei David"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121140,"name":"Presentation (20m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120909,"name":"Introductory and overview"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25859,"room":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null},{"id":"355107","title":"Network Engineering Goes DevOoopsie","description":"I sit here and reflect back to 2008 when my supervisor suggested I look into the CCNA and Network+.

Mainly, it’s using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML & Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat, if need be. Since it’s written in Go, it’s compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution and ressource conservative.\r\n\r\nThe endgame is the Reputation engine though. If you want to partake in the network to benefit from its findings, CrowdSec captures all aggression signals (timestamp, IP, behavior) and sends them for curation. That way, it establishes a reliable IP blacklist that is constantly redistributed to the network members, in order to achieve a form of Digital Herd Immunity. An IP caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members using CrowdSec that subscribed to the WordPress defense collection. In that way, we share the IPs that are relevant to your technical context.\r\n\r\nWhile Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by \"bouncers\" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack : \r\n\r\n* via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set\r\n* via Nginx lua plugin\r\n* via Traefik middleware\r\n* on Cloudflare via our bouncer that integrates with Cloudflare API\r\n* Or GCP/AWS/Azure firewall, slack or scripting, notifications, etc.\r\n\r\n.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything. \r\n\r\nThis approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, kubernetes, serverless and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we intend to create and share the most accurate database of malevolent actors as possible, under the form of a real-time IP reputation system, accessible through API. Whenever an attack is locally blocked/detected by Crowdsec, the \"meta\" information of the attack is shared amongst participants (source ip, date and triggered scenario) for redistribution to network members.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to building a strong community, with all that it implies :\r\n* [a public hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net) to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios and blockers\r\n* permissive open-source license to stay business friendly\r\n* and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality, by tooling and behavior\r\n\r\nThe microservice architecture is the most significant security challenge in a Kubernetes cluster. Every application you deploy opens a new potential entry for attackers, increasing the attack surface.\r\nIn this talk, we'll present the Crowdsec project and see how we can protect a kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec and the power of the Crowd.\r\n","startsAt":"2022-10-03T14:45:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T15:25:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"0cbcbc69-645a-44e6-b8ba-c81d3a0f4a59","name":"Hamza Essahely"},{"id":"bbff0ea2-cc32-4655-9be8-2936a4a805ce","name":"Sebastien Blot"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120910,"name":"Intermediate"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25860,"room":"ControlPlane Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null},{"id":"360162","title":"Policy + Cloud Controllers = Secure Scalable Dev-Centric Infrastructure.","description":"In large organizations, securing cloud infrastructure around Kubernetes is hard.

If GitOps is a great solution for apps, isn't it safe to assume that it would be equally beneficial for anything else?

We need to expand Kubernetes with custom resources that can manage anything, no matter whether that's AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, GitHub, Elastic, DataDog, or any other Cloud service. If we do that, we might convert Kubernetes API into a universal API. We might convert the Kubernetes control plane into a universal control plane. If we do that, we will get end-to-end GitOps through which everything is always in sync and where all we have to do is push changes to Git repositories.\r\n\r\nAll we need to make that happen is Crossplane (an open-source project donated to CNCF), combined with Argo CD, Flux, or Rancher Fleet.

However, it is not that easy. \r\nThese phrases can only help if you know what they mean! Demystifying this path to leadership in Open Source is imperative to the industry because we can’t grow on a path to continuous learning if we aren’t welcoming the next generation of contributors to our projects with clear and inclusive language.  \r\n \r\nSo here are some better questions to ask yourself when approaching a new Open Source project:  \r\nWhat can I do if the first issues queue doesn’t contain any issues to work on?  \r\nHow do I introduce myself to the community?  \r\nWhat if I can't find anything on the issue queue that makes sense? \r\nWhat contributions are needed most by this community?  \r\nHow do I climb the community role ladder toward leadership?  \r\n \r\nPeople need guidance and support when climbing the mountain from the valley of becoming a new contributor to the zenith of maintainership.

Mainly, it’s using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML & Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat, if need be. Since it’s written in Go, it’s compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution and ressource conservative.\r\n\r\nThe endgame is the Reputation engine though. If you want to partake in the network to benefit from its findings, CrowdSec captures all aggression signals (timestamp, IP, behavior) and sends them for curation. That way, it establishes a reliable IP blacklist that is constantly redistributed to the network members, in order to achieve a form of Digital Herd Immunity. An IP caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members using CrowdSec that subscribed to the WordPress defense collection. In that way, we share the IPs that are relevant to your technical context.\r\n\r\nWhile Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by \"bouncers\" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack : \r\n\r\n* via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set\r\n* via Nginx lua plugin\r\n* via Traefik middleware\r\n* on Cloudflare via our bouncer that integrates with Cloudflare API\r\n* Or GCP/AWS/Azure firewall, slack or scripting, notifications, etc.\r\n\r\n.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything. \r\n\r\nThis approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, kubernetes, serverless and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we intend to create and share the most accurate database of malevolent actors as possible, under the form of a real-time IP reputation system, accessible through API. Whenever an attack is locally blocked/detected by Crowdsec, the \"meta\" information of the attack is shared amongst participants (source ip, date and triggered scenario) for redistribution to network members.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to building a strong community, with all that it implies :\r\n* [a public hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net) to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios and blockers\r\n* permissive open-source license to stay business friendly\r\n* and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality, by tooling and behavior\r\n\r\nThe microservice architecture is the most significant security challenge in a Kubernetes cluster. Every application you deploy opens a new potential entry for attackers, increasing the attack surface.\r\nIn this talk, we'll present the Crowdsec project and see how we can protect a kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec and the power of the Crowd.\r\n","startsAt":"2022-10-03T14:45:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T15:25:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"0cbcbc69-645a-44e6-b8ba-c81d3a0f4a59","name":"Hamza Essahely"},{"id":"bbff0ea2-cc32-4655-9be8-2936a4a805ce","name":"Sebastien Blot"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120910,"name":"Intermediate"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25860,"room":"ControlPlane Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null},"index":1}]},{"slotStart":"15:30:00","rooms":[{"id":25859,"name":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","session":{"id":"342887","title":"Deploying a simple (Python) app to Kubernetes/OpenShift","description":"JJ will walk you through deploying a simple python application to Kubernetes/OpenShift.

One more piece is missing to address the needs of non-technical stakeholders within the ever-changing CICD landscape.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will attempt to automate the non-automatable with ReleaseOps: GitOps for the people.","startsAt":"2022-10-04T15:30:00","endsAt":"2022-10-04T16:10:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"1559cccc-ed7c-4296-973d-3b05f3c3d25e","name":"Lian Li"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120909,"name":"Introductory and overview"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25859,"room":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null},"index":0},{"id":25860,"name":"ControlPlane Room","session":{"id":"379915","title":"Gateway APIs and API Gateways - modern ingress demystified","description":"Up until now, Ingress routes into K8s clusters have been defined by the Ingress kind, or by vendor-specific CRDs.

However, it does not provide any capabilities for having more granular control on what resources can be created and what properties they might have. Validation webhooks fix that problem.

Mainly, it’s using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML & Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat, if need be. Since it’s written in Go, it’s compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution and ressource conservative.\r\n\r\nThe endgame is the Reputation engine though. If you want to partake in the network to benefit from its findings, CrowdSec captures all aggression signals (timestamp, IP, behavior) and sends them for curation. That way, it establishes a reliable IP blacklist that is constantly redistributed to the network members, in order to achieve a form of Digital Herd Immunity. An IP caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members using CrowdSec that subscribed to the WordPress defense collection. In that way, we share the IPs that are relevant to your technical context.\r\n\r\nWhile Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by \"bouncers\" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack : \r\n\r\n* via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set\r\n* via Nginx lua plugin\r\n* via Traefik middleware\r\n* on Cloudflare via our bouncer that integrates with Cloudflare API\r\n* Or GCP/AWS/Azure firewall, slack or scripting, notifications, etc.\r\n\r\n.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything. \r\n\r\nThis approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, kubernetes, serverless and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we intend to create and share the most accurate database of malevolent actors as possible, under the form of a real-time IP reputation system, accessible through API. Whenever an attack is locally blocked/detected by Crowdsec, the \"meta\" information of the attack is shared amongst participants (source ip, date and triggered scenario) for redistribution to network members.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to building a strong community, with all that it implies :\r\n* [a public hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net) to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios and blockers\r\n* permissive open-source license to stay business friendly\r\n* and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality, by tooling and behavior\r\n\r\nThe microservice architecture is the most significant security challenge in a Kubernetes cluster. Every application you deploy opens a new potential entry for attackers, increasing the attack surface.\r\nIn this talk, we'll present the Crowdsec project and see how we can protect a kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec and the power of the Crowd.\r\n","startsAt":"2022-10-03T14:45:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T15:25:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"0cbcbc69-645a-44e6-b8ba-c81d3a0f4a59","name":"Hamza Essahely"},{"id":"bbff0ea2-cc32-4655-9be8-2936a4a805ce","name":"Sebastien Blot"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120910,"name":"Intermediate"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25860,"room":"ControlPlane Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null}]},{"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Mortimer","fullName":"Henry Mortimer","bio":"Henry is a security engineer at ControlPlane.

What about \"look at the good first issues\" or \"triage the issues queue\"?  Or even \"go out there and make yourself known to the community\"? Open Source project members throw around these phrases as if they are the panacea to becoming a contributor, then a committer, and finally a maintainer. However, it is not that easy. \r\nThese phrases can only help if you know what they mean! Demystifying this path to leadership in Open Source is imperative to the industry because we can’t grow on a path to continuous learning if we aren’t welcoming the next generation of contributors to our projects with clear and inclusive language.  \r\n \r\nSo here are some better questions to ask yourself when approaching a new Open Source project:  \r\nWhat can I do if the first issues queue doesn’t contain any issues to work on?  \r\nHow do I introduce myself to the community?  \r\nWhat if I can't find anything on the issue queue that makes sense? \r\nWhat contributions are needed most by this community?  \r\nHow do I climb the community role ladder toward leadership?  \r\n \r\nPeople need guidance and support when climbing the mountain from the valley of becoming a new contributor to the zenith of maintainership. It is not always just as simple as following the community contributor guidelines. In this presentation I cover tips and trick on how to conquer that journey.

The pattern has seen increased usage and adoption in production environments and serves a variety of platform-agnostic use cases such as collecting metrics and proxying traffic. Sidecar containers work well with most Kubernetes primitives, such as deployments, but they fall short when used in job objects. For service meshes or metric collectors, sidecars need to run continuously, blocking jobs from completing even after the main container has finished its work. \r\n","startsAt":"2022-10-03T14:20:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T14:40:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"90531675-78bd-4c6d-af22-8c2bb0f4bb09","name":"Matei David"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121140,"name":"Presentation (20m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120909,"name":"Introductory and overview"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25859,"room":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null}]},{"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Turner","fullName":"Matt Turner","bio":"Matt is a software engineer at Tetrate, where he loves sharing what he's learning with the whole community.

Mainly, it’s using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML & Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat, if need be. Since it’s written in Go, it’s compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution and ressource conservative.\r\n\r\nThe endgame is the Reputation engine though. If you want to partake in the network to benefit from its findings, CrowdSec captures all aggression signals (timestamp, IP, behavior) and sends them for curation. That way, it establishes a reliable IP blacklist that is constantly redistributed to the network members, in order to achieve a form of Digital Herd Immunity. An IP caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members using CrowdSec that subscribed to the WordPress defense collection. In that way, we share the IPs that are relevant to your technical context.\r\n\r\nWhile Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by \"bouncers\" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack : \r\n\r\n* via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set\r\n* via Nginx lua plugin\r\n* via Traefik middleware\r\n* on Cloudflare via our bouncer that integrates with Cloudflare API\r\n* Or GCP/AWS/Azure firewall, slack or scripting, notifications, etc.\r\n\r\n.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything. \r\n\r\nThis approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, kubernetes, serverless and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we intend to create and share the most accurate database of malevolent actors as possible, under the form of a real-time IP reputation system, accessible through API. Whenever an attack is locally blocked/detected by Crowdsec, the \"meta\" information of the attack is shared amongst participants (source ip, date and triggered scenario) for redistribution to network members.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to building a strong community, with all that it implies :\r\n* [a public hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net) to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios and blockers\r\n* permissive open-source license to stay business friendly\r\n* and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality, by tooling and behavior\r\n\r\nThe microservice architecture is the most significant security challenge in a Kubernetes cluster. Every application you deploy opens a new potential entry for attackers, increasing the attack surface.\r\nIn this talk, we'll present the Crowdsec project and see how we can protect a kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec and the power of the Crowd.\r\n","startsAt":"2022-10-03T14:45:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T15:25:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"0cbcbc69-645a-44e6-b8ba-c81d3a0f4a59","name":"Hamza Essahely"},{"id":"bbff0ea2-cc32-4655-9be8-2936a4a805ce","name":"Sebastien Blot"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120910,"name":"Intermediate"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25860,"room":"ControlPlane Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null}]},{"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Emms","fullName":"Simon Emms","bio":"Simon has been working as a software engineer since 2006, in which time he's done work for the likes of Gitpod, DPD, Specsavers, British Pathé, the NHS, the Red Cross and others.

This talk is all about the challenges and perils of doing a high stakes, real world, zero downtime Kubernetes migration at scale 🤓 We’ll talk about the constraints and challenges, including:\r\n\r\n- the complexity, diversity and quantity of the systems running on the cluster\r\n- downtime having real human impact with someone potentially not being able to pay for food or make a rent payment\r\n- the sheer number of different services and teams to interact with which meant that we had to adopt an automated process that was fully transparent to other engineers\r\n\r\nWe’ll dive into some of the technical details that allowed us to migrate within these constraints, and our plans for rearchitecting our platform to make future upgrades and migrations easier.\r\n\r\nTakeaways will include:\r\n\r\n- How Kubernetes makes infrastructure migrations more manageable\r\n- Actionable learnings about doing migrations at scale in general","startsAt":"2022-10-03T14:00:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T14:40:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"5019a8c2-7d5a-455f-bb92-a961426ceb5d","name":"Miles Bryant"},{"id":"57870761-7278-4d97-9395-1f1a87ccc39d","name":"Suhail Patel"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120911,"name":"Advanced"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25860,"room":"ControlPlane Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null}]},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Meadows","fullName":"Thomas Meadows","bio":null,"tagLine":null,"profilePicture":"https://sessionize.com/image/e6de-400o400o2-BxHCAZWuQRqbf131k2F7ry.jpg","links":[],"sessions":[{"id":"390593","title":"Fireside Chat: Open Source and the Global Security Response","description":"Host: Amanda Brock, CEO, OpenUK\r\nAndrew Martin, Control Plane Founder and CEO and OpenUK CISO\r\nLiz Rice, Chief Open Source Officer, Isovalent and OpenUK Director\r\nThomas Meadows, Solutions Engineer, Jetstack","startsAt":"2022-10-04T10:45:00","endsAt":"2022-10-04T11:25:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"00aff0f5-9601-472b-8160-4514502e7e6a","name":"Amanda Brock"},{"id":"30968699-c1ac-4eb9-8866-71cefe09a983","name":"Andrew Martin"},{"id":"e48a182b-1cac-4e51-93b5-5e82408a6116","name":"Liz Rice"},{"id":"3205a45b-0c6c-46ac-a3e1-3600f17f940d","name":"Thomas Meadows"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120910,"name":"Intermediate"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25859,"room":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null}]},{"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Farcic","fullName":"Viktor Farcic","bio":"Viktor Farcic is a Developer Advocate at Upbound, a member of the Google Developer Experts and Docker Captains groups, and a published author.\r\n\r\nHis big passions are DevOps, Containers, Kubernetes, Microservices, Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD).\r\n\r\nHe often speaks at community gatherings and conferences.\r\n\r\nHe published The DevOps Toolkit Series (https://www.devopstoolkitseries.com/), DevOps Paradox (https://amzn.to/2myrYYA) and Test-Driven Java Development (http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Java-Development-Viktor-Farcic-ebook/dp/B00YSIM3SC), as well as courses in Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/user/viktor-farcic/).\r\n\r\nHis random thoughts and tutorials can be found in his blog TechnologyConversations.com.\r\n\r\nHe is the host of the DevOps Toolkit (https://youtube.com/c/devopstoolkit) YouTube channel and a co-host of DevOps Paradox (https://www.devopsparadox.com/) podcast.","tagLine":"Developer Advocate","profilePicture":"https://sessionize.com/image/3119-400o400o2-KwmEomPTBJ9PckZkggq9ih.jpg","links":[{"title":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/vfarcic","linkType":"Twitter"},{"title":"LinkedIn","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktorfarcic/","linkType":"LinkedIn"},{"title":"Blog","url":"https://youtube.com/@DevOpsToolkit","linkType":"Blog"}],"sessions":[{"id":"355030","title":"Applying GitOps To Everything","description":"You are likely already using GitOps for your applications, but not for everything else. You are likely not using Argo CD, Flux, Rancher Fleet, or similar tools to manage the state of your infrastructure and services. Why is that? If GitOps is a great solution for apps, isn't it safe to assume that it would be equally beneficial for anything else? What is missing?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that most of the commonly used GitOps tools are managing Kubernetes resources which, traditionally, do not deal with infrastructure and Cloud services. That's what we need to change. We need to expand Kubernetes with custom resources that can manage anything, no matter whether that's AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, GitHub, Elastic, DataDog, or any other Cloud service. If we do that, we might convert Kubernetes API into a universal API. We might convert the Kubernetes control plane into a universal control plane. If we do that, we will get end-to-end GitOps through which everything is always in sync and where all we have to do is push changes to Git repositories.\r\n\r\nAll we need to make that happen is Crossplane (an open-source project donated to CNCF), combined with Argo CD, Flux, or Rancher Fleet. Let's see it in action.","startsAt":"2022-10-03T09:45:00","endsAt":"2022-10-03T10:25:00","isServiceSession":false,"isPlenumSession":false,"speakers":[{"id":"97fd9697-d280-4391-8e99-0e4698bc76db","name":"Viktor Farcic"}],"categories":[{"id":38933,"name":"Session format","categoryItems":[{"id":121139,"name":"Presentation (40m)"}],"sort":0},{"id":38934,"name":"Level","categoryItems":[{"id":120909,"name":"Introductory and overview"}],"sort":2}],"roomId":25859,"room":"Lloyds Banking Group Room","liveUrl":null,"recordingUrl":null}]}]}
